# Movie-Lens-Data-Exploration
The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The data is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions. However, I will be using this data to act as a means to demonstrate my skill in using Python to “play” with data.

Below skills are unleashed as part of this project

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualization using Python

Pandas – groupby, merging
